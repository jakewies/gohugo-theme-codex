## Codex

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

is a minimal blog theme built for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) 🍜 by [Jake Wies](https://github.com/jakewies)

I have decided to use as a skeleton for my personal landing page, since it is very versatile and flexible for use.

The theme is fully responsive so it looks great on all of the devices

Features:
- blog and about page included 👍
- blog can be attached with tags 🏷
- blog uses markdown language for its syntax 
- included social media icons with animations

### For use

Fork this repo, and change `theme.toml` based on your preference, you may also add custom features/fonts/colors accordingly (checkout `themes/codex/layouts` etc.). Have fun :)
